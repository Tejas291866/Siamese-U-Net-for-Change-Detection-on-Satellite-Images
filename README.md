# Siamese-U-Net-for-Change-Detection-on-Satellite-Images
This repository contains the implementation of a Siamese U-Net model for detecting changes in satellite images. The model has been trained on the WHU RS Change Detection Dataset and produces a binary change map highlighting regions of significant differences between pre-change and post-change images.
